This project represents the culmination of my bachelor thesis "Full text of laws" (original: "Úplné znění zákonů ČR"), which I successfully defended and received a prestigious Dean's Award for the best bachelor thesis in Computer Science.

Text of the thesis, containing the description of the program and the documentation, can be found in the university repository: https://dspace.cuni.cz/handle/20.500.11956/54970

## Abstract

The full text of a legal act represents a consolidated text of the act, that is derived from the original version by applying changes contained in amendments to the law. The aim of this work is to design and implement an application for efficient and correct extraction and interpretation of text of legislation acts contained in the Collection of Laws of the Czech Republic and for automatic generating of full text of laws based on the original version of the legal act and its amendments. Secondary objectives include creating a database of all publications of the Collection and legal acts, procedures for finding dependencies between legal acts and their amendments and procedures for automatic downloading and indexing of newly issued publications of the Collection.
